# Today's session (Day 18)
- Max Path Sum 
- LCA of Binary Tree
- Serialize and Deserialize 


## Struggles
Implementation based

Understanding exactly what to return from recursive functions
Properly tracking information across recursive calls
Handling edge cases like null nodes
Distinguishing between global state and the return value
Identify Invariants, let properties of datastructures solve problems implicitly 


## Session 2

- Zig Zag traversal of binary tree
- Boundary Traversal of binary tree
- Top View of binary tree
- Bottom view of binary tree
- Vertical order traversal



Tomorrow's Questions
