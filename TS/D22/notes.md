# Today's session (Day 18)
- Max Width of a Binary Tree
- Find Path from Root to target node
- Children Sum


## Struggles
State tracker with accumulator patternn from Second question

Similar Problems
- Collect all paths from root to leaf
- Check if path with given sum exists
- Binary Tree Max Path sum


- A dedicated helper function that handles recursion
- Parameters to track state values as they change with each recursive call
- Clear logic for when and how to modify state (in what order?)
- Backtracking when state reverting is needed
- Proper base/terminal/edge cases
- Return values that signal success or failure to provide data to parent calls


## Session 2
Didn't hold, girl wanted sex - will revisit
